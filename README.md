# swana-census-analysis

This analysis was conducted for the March 27, 2019, Los Angeles Times story ["Are Arabs and Iranians white? Census says yes, but many disagree"]().

It found roughly 3 million people of Southwest Asian, Middle Eastern or North African descent live in the United States. No county is home to more of these communities than Los Angeles, where more than 350,000 people can trace their roots to a region that stretches from Mauritania to the mountains of Afghanistan. In past census surveys, more than 80% in this group have called themselves white.
